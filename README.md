# 42_pushswap
WIP - push swap, a 42 school project

# Efficiency vs Efficacy
- What's the difference between them?
- Which one is required for the ```push_swap``` project?

## Real Case Study
Let's suppose that you need to commute from your house to your work by car, but here is a traffic jam ahead, like Mr. Goofy from Disney: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tlk6e61E6w.

## Efficiency - The goal, whatever it takes
You can drive like Mr. Goofy but at crazy mode accelerating a lot, changing lanes every second, hitting brakes... and eventually arriving at work.
Did you make the goal? Yes. But probably, you burned some really important resources from your car (gas, oil, brakes, engine), and from yourself (mental health, stress, anxiety, etc...)

## Efficacy - The goal, with minimal resources
But you can also goes like the initial state from Mr. Goofy: a pleasant guy which could find another path or even wait with pacience and love the innevitable truth: there is a traffic jam.

## Push_Swap - Which one is required?
Push Swap is about a program that **sort numbers** from user's input, but also:
- has 2 stacks to store the given numbers;
- has 11 basic functions to move the numbers between stacks;
- calculates the total moviments to sort them;
