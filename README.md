# 42_pushswap
WIP - push swap, a 42 school project about ordination algorithm.

# Efficiency vs Efficacy
- What's the difference between them?
- Which one is required for the ```push_swap``` project?

## Real Case Study
Let's suppose that you need to commute from your house to your work by car, but here is a traffic jam ahead, like Mr. Goofy from Disney:

## Efficiency - The goal, whatever it takes
You can drive like Mr. Goofy but at crazy mode accelerating a lot, changing lanes every second, hitting brakes... and eventually arriving at work.

### Did you make the goal? **Yes**.
But probably, you burned some really important resources from your car (gas, oil, brakes, engine), and from yourself (mental health, stress, anxiety, etc...)

## Efficacy - The goal, with minimal resources
However, you can also goes like the initial state from Mr. Goofy: a pleasant guy which could find another path or even just wait with pacience and love the innevitable truth: there will be a traffic jam ahead.

### Did you make the goal? **Yes**.
Without burning your brain, tires and fuel unnecessarily.

## Push_Swap - Which one is required?
Push Swap is about a program that **sort numbers** from user's input, but also:
- has 2 stacks to store the given numbers;
- has 11 basic functions to move the numbers between stacks;
- calculates the total moviments to sort them;
- .
